  "summary": "### AI Overview\n\nCustomer feedback for this dog chew toy is generally positive, with a majority of users highlighting its appeal to dogs, especially those who enjoy chewing, and its playful design. The most discussed themes are durability, scent/flavor, size and weight, and suitability for different types of chewers. While many customers praise the toy\u2019s toughness and entertainment value, a significant portion express concerns about its actual durability for aggressive chewers, the strong chemical smell, and issues with size and weight for smaller dogs. The overall tone is enthusiastic but polarized, with a notable split between highly satisfied owners of moderate chewers and frustrated buyers whose dogs quickly destroyed the toy or ignored it.\n\n---\n\n### Product Theme Analysis\n\n#### Durability and Suitability for Chewers\n\n**Positive:**  \nMany customers are impressed with the toy\u2019s ability to withstand moderate to heavy chewing, often noting that it lasts longer than other toys and keeps their dogs engaged. One reviewer shares, *\"My dog love this. He is a tough chewer and it has lasted two weeks. I will order this again. Highly recommend.\"* Another adds, *\"This toy has lasted at least two weeks. The toy we buy usually last a day if we are lucky. Would recommend this for powerful chewer.\"*\n\n**Negative:**  \nHowever, a substantial number of reviews contradict these claims, especially from owners of aggressive chewers. Reports of the toy breaking apart within minutes are common: *\"Our javanese loved it for a time. He is a heavy chewer so I mistakenly thought this toy would be ok. After his second time with it, he had bitten a piece off and it was in his mouth. Needless to say that piece and the rest of this chew toy went out.\"* Another frustrated customer notes, *\"Not for heavy chewer. Within 10 minutes a chunk was chewed off. Bought 2 & returning them.\"*\n\n#### Scent and Flavor\n\n**Positive:**  \nThe peanut butter scent and flavor are frequently cited as a major draw for dogs, with many owners reporting that their pets are immediately attracted to the toy. *\"The Frisco Peanut Butter flavored pretzel was a big hit. My three year old lab was very excited as soon as I showed it to him... It is very durable and didn't even show a mark by the time he was done.\"* Another reviewer says, *\"Upon taking it out of the packaging, not only was I impressed with the delicious smell of peanut butter, but so was my pup.\"*\n\n**Negative:**  \nConversely, a significant number of customers complain about a strong, unpleasant chemical or rubber odor that either overpowers the peanut butter scent or deters their dogs entirely. *\"The terrible chemical smell put me right off the two items from this manufacturer. I was actually angry.\"* Others echo, *\"My 3 mini Aussies smell it and walk away. It has a strong rubber smell and they don't want anything to do with it.\"*\n\n#### Size and Weight\n\n**Positive:**  \nFor larger dogs, the toy\u2019s size and heft are appreciated, as it provides a substantial object to chew and play with. *\"The large pretzel is the perfect size and the rubber is extremely durable. She can catch it in the air and it also has a fun bounce to it.\"*\n\n**Negative:**  \nHowever, many owners of small or medium dogs find the toy too large or heavy, making it difficult for their pets to play with or even pick up. *\"Too heavy for a 9 pound dog.\"* Another review states, *\"I received the small/medium size... it's simply too big for my little guy. He's a hair under 8.5lbs and this is the size of his head. I'm not sure he could even get his mouth around it.\"*\n\n#### Engagement and Play Value\n\n**Positive:**  \nCustomers frequently mention that the toy keeps their dogs entertained, both as a chew and as a fetch toy. *\"It's one of my dog's favorite toys. He plays with it for long periods of time and still enjoys it.\"* The toy\u2019s bounce and unique pretzel shape are also highlighted as fun features.\n\n**Negative:**  \nSome dogs, however, show little to no interest in the toy, regardless of its scent or design. *\"My dog showed no interest at all. I don't think it smells like peanut butter at all. My dog did not play or try to chew. He completely ignored the toy.\"* Others mention that initial excitement quickly fades: *\"My dog was very interested to start but the interest quickly wore off.\"*\n\n---\n\n### Other Considerations\n\n- **Safety Concerns:** Several reviewers express worry about dogs breaking off and ingesting pieces, especially for aggressive chewers. *\"My dog loved chewing on it but he was able to gnaw off pieces and swallow them. I had to throw it away.\"*\n- **Polarized Ratings:** The star rating distribution is notably split, with a high number of 5-star reviews (187) but also a significant number of 1- and 2-star ratings (68 and 30, respectively), reflecting the product\u2019s inconsistent performance across different dog types.\n- **Time Trends:** Sentiment appears relatively stable over time, with no clear trend toward improvement or decline in product experience.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCustomer experiences with this chew toy are highly dependent on the size and chewing style of the dog. While many owners of moderate chewers and larger dogs praise its durability, scent, and entertainment value, a substantial group of buyers\u2014especially those with aggressive chewers or small dogs\u2014report rapid destruction, safety concerns, and issues with odor or lack of interest. Product teams should note the need for clearer guidance on sizing and suitability for different chewer types, as well as potential improvements to scent formulation and material safety. The toy is a hit for the right dog, but expectations must be managed for others."
