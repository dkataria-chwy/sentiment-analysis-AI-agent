It feel sturdy and ha some weight to it The peanut butter smell is subtle and doesn't seem too chemically all thing considered I admit that I haven't sampled the product myself so I can't comment on the taste All in all I imagine it could withstand some abuse I received the small/medium size the smallest available and it's simply too big for my little guy he's a hair under 8.5lbs and this is the size of his head i'm not sure he could even get his mouth around it He also isn't blessed in the having teeth department he's a senior not a pro boxer so this may just not be the toy for him He really didn't express any interest in it beyond a sniff but likely because of the toothlessness, chew toy have never really been his thing he's a stuffed animal guy Nothing against the product itself i'm only knocking off a star because the small size probably isn't suitable for many small dog for at least teensy dog",
