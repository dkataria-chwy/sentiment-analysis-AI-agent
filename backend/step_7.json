      "Hard to chew up",
      "The product itself is super cute and well-made. It feel sturdy and ha some weight to it The peanut butter smell is subtle and doesn't seem too chemically all thing considered I admit that I haven't sampled the product myself so I can't comment on the taste All in all I imagine it could withstand some abuse I received the small/medium size the smallest available and it's simply too big for my little guy he's a hair under 8.5lbs and this is the size of his head i'm not sure he could even get his mouth around it He also isn't blessed in the having teeth department he's a senior not a pro boxer so this may just not be the toy for him He really didn't express any interest in it beyond a sniff but likely because of the toothlessness, chew toy have never really been his thing he's a stuffed animal guy Nothing against the product itself i'm only knocking off a star because the small size probably isn't suitable for many small dog for at least teensy dog",

      "This toy is chunky and heavy even for big dog i ordered the large/x-large).and seems well made My dog didn't use it very much because he ha teeth issue I think it would be good to help keep teeth clean for a large dog He wasn't particularly interested in the flavor I would only use this toy with supervision because I'd be concerned the dog could chew chunk loose and possibly choke on them but I believe all toy use should be supervised Four star instead of five because it is very heavy even for my big boy",
      "When this arrived the label said it wa actually only for moderate chewer I gave it to my dog anyway for a highly supervised try but she wa able to start ripping off the end of the pretzel that stick out from the bottom within about 10 minute of playing with this toy (FYI, this wa the small pretzel My dog is a 10-lb poodle mix i she's a determined chewer but definitely no giant jaw here",

      "Received the small/medium pretzel maybe should\u2019ve had the larger one It took a few minute for my dog to notice it but when she did she loved it unfortunately it only lasted about seven minute before she'd managed to chew off and ingest one of the little nub It went into the trash i Maybe the donut would work Any little bit are her target",

        "My mini dachshund puppy love this durable toy for chewing The texture feel good on his new adult teeth and he love a bouncy rubber chew to now on The scent wa kind of a mix between new rubber and peanut butter but the funky smell only lasted a couple day For a destructive chewer he ha yet to cause any dent in this one which is a good thing",
