      "This toy is chunky and heavy even for big dog i ordered the large/x-large).and seems well made My dog didn't use it very much because he ha teeth issue I think it would be good to help keep teeth clean for a large dog He wasn't particularly interested in the flavor I would only use this toy with supervision because I'd be concerned the dog could chew chunk loose and possibly choke on them but I believe all toy use should be supervised Four star instead of five because it is very heavy even for my big boy",

        "The product itself is super cute and well-made. It feel sturdy and ha some weight to it The peanut butter smell is subtle and doesn't seem too chemically all thing considered I admit that I haven't sampled the product myself so I can't comment on the taste All in all I imagine it could withstand some abuse I received the small/medium size the smallest available and it's simply too big for my little guy he's a hair under 8.5lbs and this is the size of his head i'm not sure he could even get his mouth around it He also isn't blessed in the having teeth department he's a senior not a pro boxer so this may just not be the toy for him He really didn't express any interest in it beyond a sniff but likely because of the toothlessness, chew toy have never really been his thing he's a stuffed animal guy Nothing against the product itself i'm only knocking off a star because the small size probably isn't suitable for many small dog for at least teensy dog",

        "This Pretzel is super cute and I could tell it wa packed with care It came wrapped in plastic and with a little tag It wa easy to open the packaging it came in I like to give my dog vegan option when I can and having the peanut butter flavor is great if your dog is restricted from certain meat due to allergy It really smell like peanut butter right when you open it I could smell it on the other side of the room My dog love to chew on this and it ha held up to him really well it's a bouncy kind of chew toy so if you get hit with it because they drop it on your foot or if they're thrashing around with it it won't hurt No sign of usage on it at all and he seems to like the texture 10/10!!",

        "As a human pretzel lover myself had to get a pretzel chew toy for my poodle Upon taking it out of the packaging,not only wa I impressed with the delicious smell of peanut butternut so wa my pup The texture is very soft and chewy,almost like a movie theatre or amusement park pretzel for your pup He loved the smell,the size,taste and the overall feel of this toy It kept him busy for a long time Highly reccomend!",
        "I had to give this pretzel a shot when I read it wa a durable chew toy It ha a rubber texture and my 2 year old Aussie ha in the past destroyed these sort of chew toy in minute He straight up shred it so you know I wa worried about if it'll handle his tough chewing I wa honestly not expecting it to be a durable a it wa I'm truly shocked by it While he did chew off the two little pretzel nub the rest of the pretzel ha held together Even chewing off the nub took him about an hour to do so A few hour of chewing after that and the rest of it ha no puncture still While it's the most durable rubber chew I have found it's still not a chew toy I would feel comfortable letting him have without supervision I highly recommend this chew He wa so excited just from the smell alone He wouldn't wait to let me get some picture It also ha little groove to help with teeth cleaning I found the groove were great to put a little doggie toothpaste in for some extra cleaning action a well",
