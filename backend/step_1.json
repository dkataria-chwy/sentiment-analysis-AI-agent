Attached it to my waist (I\u2019m 5\u20194) my dogs couldn\u2019t move to my sides because the leashes were too tight and the loops were in the front (causing me to literally walk over them when attempting to use this) \n\n\n\nGave this two stars because I use the belt still, but with different leashes and to carry other things. Super useful if you\u2019re thrifty!",
