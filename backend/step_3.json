It has a rubber texture and my 2 year old Aussie has in the past destroyed these sort of chew toys in minutes. He straight up shreds it so you know I was worried about if it'll handle his tough chewing. I was honestly not expecting it to be as durable as it was. I'm truly shocked by it. While he did chew off the two little pretzel nubs, the rest of the pretzel has held together.  Even chewing off the nubs took him about an hour to do so. A few hours of chewing after that and the rest of it has no punctures still. While it's the most durable rubber chew I have found, it's still not a chew toy I would feel comfortable letting him have without supervision. I highly recommend this chew! He was so excited just from the smell alone! He wouldn't wait to let me get some pictures! It also has little grooves to help with teeth cleaning. I found the grooves were great to put a little doggie toothpaste in for some extra cleaning action as well!",

The peanut butter smell is subtle and doesn\u2019t seem too chemical-y, all things considered. I admit that I haven\u2019t sampled the product myself so I can\u2019t comment on the taste. All in all, I imagine it could withstand some abuse. \n\nI received the small/medium size (the smallest available) and it\u2019s simply too big for my little guy. He\u2019s a hair under 8.5lbs and this is the size of his head. I\u2019m not sure he could even get his mouth around it. He also isn\u2019t blessed in the \u201chaving teeth\u201d department (he\u2019s a senior, not a pro boxer) so this may just not be the toy for him. He really didn\u2019t express any interest in it beyond a sniff but, likely because of the toothlessness, chew toys have never really been his thing. He\u2019s a stuffed animal guy. Nothing against the product itself. I\u2019m only knocking off a star because the small size probably isn\u2019t suitable for many small dogs (or at least teensy dogs).",

    "customer_review": "This Pretzel is super cute, and I could tell it was packed with care. It came wrapped in plastic and with a little tag. It was easy to open the packaging it came in. I like to give my dog vegan options when I can, and having the peanut butter flavor is great if your dog is restricted from certain meats due to allergies. It really smells like peanut butter right when you open it, I could smell it on the other side of the room! My dog loves to chew on this and it has held up to him really well. It\u2019s a bouncy kind of chew toy so if you get hit with it because they drop it on your feet or if they\u2019re thrashing around with it, it won\u2019t hurt. No signs of usage on it at all and he seems to like the texture. 10/10!!",
